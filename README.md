# ðŸ“Œ Library Management System

## ðŸ“„ Brief Description

This project implements a **Library Management System** that enables administrators to efficiently manage books, borrowers, and loans in a library setting. The system addresses the challenges of manual tracking by offering a web-based interface integrated with a MySQL backend. It supports entity management (books, users, loans), real-time reporting, user authentication, and access control.

## ðŸŽ¯ Functional & Non-functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- Manage core entities: books, borrowers, authors, and loans
- Perform CRUD operations on all entities
- Track borrowing history and overdue loans
- Generate daily/monthly/yearly reports using SQL views and aggregations
- Provide authentication with roles: Admin, Librarian, User
- Implement stored procedures (e.g., borrow/return book) and triggers (e.g., update availability)

### Non-functional Requirements:
- Database normalization up to 3NF
- Security via user roles and encrypted passwords
- Fast query execution through indexing and optimization
- Responsive, dynamic web UI
- Code reproducibility and clear documentation

## ðŸ§± Planned Core Entities (brief outline)

- **Book**: ID, Title, Author_ID, Genre, ISBN, Status
- **Author**: ID, Name, Nationality
- **Borrower/User**: ID, Name, Email, Role, Password
- **Loan**: ID, Book_ID, User_ID, Borrow_Date, Return_Date, Status

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL (Workbench or CLI)
- **Backend**: PHP with MySQLi
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench, GitHub, VS Code
- **Security**: MySQL encryption functions, prepared statements

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members and Roles
